# Predictive Maintenance Model for Industrial Machinery

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based **predictive maintenance system** to anticipate failures in industrial machinery. By analyzing real-time and historical sensor data, the model predicts various types of machine failures such as **tool wear**, **heat dissipation issues**, and **power failures**. This enables proactive maintenance planning, reducing downtime and operational costs.

## 📚 Project Context

This project was completed as part of an internship with **Edunet Foundation** under the **IBM SkillsBuild Program**. The development and deployment of this model utilized **IBM Cloud** tools and services, including:

- **IBM watsonx.ai Studio** for model training and deployment  
- **IBM Cloud Object Storage** for storing datasets  
- **IBM Watson Machine Learning** for model hosting and inference

## 🚀 Features

- Takes in and handles data from sensors attached to industrial machines  
- Performs feature engineering and data preprocessing  
- Trains and evaluates a classification model for failure prediction  
- Supports multi-class prediction (e.g., tool wear, heat issues, power failure)  
- Integrates with IBM Cloud services for scalable deployment

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **IBM watsonx.ai Studio**  
- **IBM Watson Machine Learning**  
- **IBM Cloud Object Storage**
